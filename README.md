# Self-balancing-Robot
This is a self-balancing robot project that mainly uses Arduino microcontroller and MPU6050 sensor. MPU6050 is an IMU (Inertial Measurment Sensor) that's being used in various applicatiopns such as, smartphones and game controllers. I included also the calibration code for the MPU6050 sensor and how it uses the I2C protocol.
